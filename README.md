# Introduction
VKFrameS (**V**ideo **K**ey**frames** **S**elector) is a video shot keyframes selector which aims to provide a set of unique keyframes for a given shot-segmented video. 

# Requirements
*   A C++ compiler, like g++
*   A functional OpenCV installation (version 2.4.x and above)
*   An appropriate set of CODECs

# Parameters
1.  The video which keyframes will be selected.
2.  A file path to the CSV output which describe the selected keyframes.
3.  (Optional) A CSV file with video shot segmentation.

# Output
VKFrameS will save it's output into a CSV file (the second provided parameter). In this file, each line corresponds to a selected keyframe. 
The first value (before the comma) is the corresponding shot number. The second value (after the comma) is the global frame number of the keyframe. The first frame and the first shot are represented as '1'.

VKFrameS can select multiple keyframes for each shot. In this case, the printing order reflects the "*quality*" of each keyframe: the first shot' keyframe is "*better*" than the second keyfame, and so on.

VKFrames will always select at least one keyframe for each non-empty shot.

If there is not a shot segmentation (the third parameter), all detected keyframes will be presented as **1,N**, where **N** is the frame number.

# Examples
## Using a shot.csv file with the 'video.avi' shot' segmentation. 
		$ ./VKFrameS video.avi output.csv shots.csv
		$ cat shots.csv
			1,240
			241,260
			272,290
			291,313
			320,325
			326,700
		$ cat output.csv
			1,123
			1,43
			2,258
			3,288
			3,289
			4,296
			5,321
			6,440
			6,599
			6,382
		
## Without the shot segmentation
		$ ./VKFrameS video.avi output.csv
		$ cat output.csv
			1,76
			1,115
			1,296
			1,440
